\begin{theorem}{Halting}{}
    The Halting Problem is undecidable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{lemma}{Lovasz-Local Lemma}{}
Let $A_1, \dots, A_n$ be sequence of events, where each event $A_i$ is dependent to at most $d$ other events and $\Pr[A_i] \le p$. 
Then, if $4pd \le 1$, then there is nonzero probability that none of the events occur.
\end{lemma}
\begin{corollary}{}{}
This is a corollary
\end{corollary}
\begin{proposition}{}{}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. A vertex cover of $G$ is a subset $S \subseteq V$ such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ is in $S$. The size of a minimum vertex cover of $G$ is always at least half the size of a maximum matching in $G$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}{}{}
    A graph $G = (V, E)$ is a pair where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E \subseteq V \times V$ is a set of edges.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}{}{}
    Consider the graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $E = \{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1)\}$. This graph forms a cycle of length 4.
\end{example}
\begin{theorem*}{}{}
    Every connected graph with $n$ vertices has at least $n-1$ edges.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{lemma*}{}{}
    In any graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges.
\end{lemma*}
\begin{corollary*}{}{}
    Every graph has an even number of vertices with odd degree.
\end{corollary*}
\begin{proposition*}{}{}
    A tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges.
\end{proposition*}
\begin{definition*}{}{}
    A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair in the sequence is connected by an edge.
\end{definition*}
\begin{example*}{}{}
